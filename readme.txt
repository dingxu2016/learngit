I am a PhD candidate who major in computational soft condensed matter atUSTC. And i'm also interested in many other field, such as deep learning , quantitative finance and numerical computation etc. 
In general, i would like to use Fortran and C to complete the computational part and process data with Matlab or Python.
If you have the same interests with me and want to do some research on these fields, welcome to contact me by senting email to dingxu@mail.ustc.edu.cn  .
